Meal Matcher helps users find recipes based on their food preferences! It allows filtering by protein, spice level, cuisine type, cooking time, vegan/gluten-free options, and allergies. You can also add new recipes to expand the collection.

## How to Run
1. Make sure `recipes.csv` is in the same folder as the Python file.
2. Run the Python file:  
   `python "Meal Matcher.py"`
3. Follow the prompts to get a dish recommendation!

## What I Learned
- Handling CSV files and text encoding issues.
- Managing file read/write permissions.
- Validating and matching user input.
- The importance of clean error handling.

## Challenges Faced
- CSV files can contain hidden characters that cause bugs.
- Files being open in Excel cause permission errors.
- Handling users who type "no" for allergies without crashing.
